## Advanced analysis and manipulation of ELAN corpus data with R and Python

This is a set of course materials Niko Partanen ([me](https://github.com/nikopartanen)) is using while teaching the this course. It is supposed to be used with a [Komi-Zyrian Test Corpus](https://github.com/langdoc/kpv-test-corpus) and the materials have an accompanying [website](https://nikopartanen.github.io/adv_elan_draft/), which is more thorough but also still more at the draft level. I work currently in LATTICE laboratory in Paris, and I'm also working with [IKDP-2](https://github.com/langdoc/IKDP-2) research project.

If you have comments or suggestions, any feedback, my email address is nikotapiopartanen@gmail.com. Opening an issue in GitHub is also ok.

The lectures assume that you have done something like:

    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/elan_lectures
    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/testcorpus
    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/praat-stuff

So when you are in the main directory what you see is:

    elan_lectures
    testcorpus
    praat-stuff

## Notes

Notes during the course were collected into [this introductory document](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures)

## Slides

The course is split along following slides:

- [Introduction](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures/lecture-1)
- [Getting test corpus into R](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures/lecture-2)
- [How does ELAN work?](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures/lecture-3)
- [More advanced example with emuR, Shiny and PraatScript](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures/lecture-4)
- [Some file manipulation examples](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures/lecture-5)

## Financial support

My work has been supported by several institutions and foundations while conducting work that has contributed into these materials:

- Funding from [Kone Foundation](https://koneensaatio.fi/) in [IKDP](https://github.com/langdoc/IKDP) and [IKDP-2](https://github.com/langdoc/IKDP-2] research projecs
- Position in 2017 in [LATTICE laboratory](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/)
- Travel grant in 2016 from [Suomalais-ugrilaisen kulttuurirahaston säätiö](http://www.sukrs.fi/)

## Attributions

There are probably tons of small improvements that could be done with attributing everyone, but at least following should be probably listed separatedly:

- Custom CSS and inspiration to use [revealjs](https://github.com/rstudio/revealjs) comes from [this presentation](https://github.com/evelinag/tabs-spaces-talk)
- Praat scripts are based into examples of [Steven Buss's formant script](https://github.com/sbuss/get-formants-for-vowels) and [Will Styler's COG script](https://github.com/stylerw/styler_praat_scripts/blob/master/peak_spectral_COG.praat)
- Different pieces of code are copied from countless blogs and posts around the internet -- if something deserves to be attributed, just let me know and I will happily add it
