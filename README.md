## Advanced analysis and manipulation of ELAN corpus data with R and Python

This is a set of course materials Niko Partanen ([me](https://github.com/nikopartanen)) is using while teaching the this course. It is supposed to be used with a [Komi-Zyrian Test Corpus](https://github.com/langdoc/kpv-test-corpus) and the materials have an accompanying [website](https://nikopartanen.github.io/adv_elan_draft/), which is more thorough but also still more at the draft level. I work currently in LATTICE laboratory in Paris, and I'm also working with [IKDP-2](https://github.com/langdoc/IKDP-2) research project.

If you have comments or suggestions, any feedback, my email address is nikotapiopartanen@gmail.com. Opening an issue in GitHub is also ok.

The lectures assume that you have done something like:

    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/elan_lectures
    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/testcorpus
    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/praat-stuff

So when you are in the main directory what you see is:

    elan_lectures
    testcorpus
    praat-stuff

## Notes

Notes during the course were collected into [this introductory document](https://langdoc.github.io/elan_lectures)
