## Advanced analysis and manipulation of ELAN corpus data with R and Python

This is a set of course materials Niko Partanen is using while teaching the this course. It is supposed to be used with a [Komi-Zyrian Test Corpus](https://github.com/langdoc/kpv-test-corpus) and the materials have an accompanying [website](https://nikopartanen.github.io/adv_elan_draft/), which is more thorough but also still more at the draft level.

The lectures assume that you have done something like:

    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/elan_lectures
    cd elan_lectures
    git clone https://github.com/langdoc/testcorpus

So the test corpus should be directly under the lectures.
